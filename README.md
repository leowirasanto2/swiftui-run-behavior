# Run Behavior App (AI powered)

**Overview**

Run Behavior is an app that tracking the user's run behavior such as how long time did user run in one time and the how far the distance covered. The app will show the suggestion when and how long should they run based on their run behavior. The suggestion generated by AI using the CoreML.
This is just for learning purpose.

**User Interface _(prototype)_**

I created a UI prototype to see what does the final product of this app.
